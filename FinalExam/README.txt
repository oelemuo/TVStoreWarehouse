# Cellphone Sales Tracker

## Description
This Java project reads cellphone brand names from a text file, tracks the number of phones sold for each brand, and calculates total sales. The program uses a data structure to store and sort the data alphabetically, then displays the overall sales for the day.

## Key Concepts
- **File I/O**: Reading from and writing to text files.
- **Data Structures**: Storing and sorting data for phone brands and sales.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Separate classes for handling different components of the system.
- **Static Methods**: Shared utility methods to avoid object instantiation where appropriate.
- **Final Variables**: Constants that remain unchanged throughout the program.
- **Javadoc Documentation**: Providing well-documented code using Javadoc for clarity and maintenance.

## How to Run
1. Download 'Final Exam' folder in repository
2. Click on src file
3. Run respective java files

## Requirements
- Java 8 or higher.

## Future Improvements
- Add a GUI for better user interaction.
- Implement a database to persist sales data.
